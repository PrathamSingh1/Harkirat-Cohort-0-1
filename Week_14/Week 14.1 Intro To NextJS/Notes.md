Step 1 - NextJS Intro, Pre-requisites

Pre-requistes 

You need to understand basic Frontend before proceeding to this track. 
You need to know what React is and how you can create a simple application in it


NextJS Intro ->

NextJS was a framework that was introduced because of some minor inconviniences in React

1. In a React project, you have to maintain a seprate Backend project for your API routes 
2. React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)
3. React is not SEO Optimised
    1. Not exactly true today because of React Server components
4. Waterfalling problem



NextJS Offerings ->

Next.js provides you the following upsides over React

1. Server side rendering - Get's rid of SEO problems
2. API routes - Single codebase with frontend and backend
3. File based routing (no need for react-router-dom)
4. Bundle size optimisations, Static site generation
5. Maintained by the Vercel team

Downsides - 

1. Can't be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does server side rendering and hence is expensive
2. Very opinionated, very hard to move out of it.
