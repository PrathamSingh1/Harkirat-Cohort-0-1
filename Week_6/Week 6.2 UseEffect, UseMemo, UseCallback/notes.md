Side effects - In React, the concept of side effects encompasses any operations that reach outside the functional scope of a React component. These operations can affect other components, interact with the browser, or perform asynchronous data fetching.

Examples- setTimeout
          fetch
          setInterval
    
Hooks - Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They enable functional components to have access to stateful logic and lifecycle features, which were previously only possible in classs components. This has led to a more concise and readable way of writing components in React.

Examples-  
 
useState
useEffect 
useCallback
useMemo
useRef
useContext
